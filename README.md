# Burp Suite Academy Write-Ups

Welcome to my Burp Suite Academy Write-Ups repository. Here, I share my detailed write-ups on solving each lab using Burp Suite Community Edition, along with accompanying Python scripts for automation.

Feel free to explore my journey through the learning paths in sequence. For specific topics, simply scroll down for more details.
