# Server-side Vulnerabilities

Server-side vulnerabilities refer to security weaknesses that exist in the backend components of web applications, such as servers, databases, and application logic. Unlike client-side vulnerabilities, which often involve manipulating user inputs or interactions, server-side vulnerabilities typically require an understanding of the underlying server operations and application architecture.

Common types of server-side vulnerabilities include SQL Injection, Authentication flaws, Path Traversal, Command Injection, and Business Logic Vulnerabilities, among others. These vulnerabilities can expose sensitive data, compromise user privacy, and even lead to complete system compromise if exploited.

Understanding server-side vulnerabilities is crucial for anyone involved in web application security, as they are often the target of malicious attackers aiming to gain unauthorized access, manipulate data, or execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Server-side Topics:

- SQL Injection
- Authentication
- [Path Traversal](/path-traversal#path-traversal)
- Command Injection
- Business Logic Vulnerabilities
- Information Disclosure
- Access Control
- File Upload Vulnerabilities
- Race Conditions
- Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- XXE Injection
- NoSQL Injection
- API Testing

_This repository focuses on the ethical hacking of web applications, also known as penetration testing or white-hat hacking. Ethical hacking involves authorized and legitimate testing to identify vulnerabilities with the aim of enhancing the security of the target systems._

_It's essential to use the techniques, tools, and methodologies discussed here only in environments where you have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized hacking or malicious activities are strictly prohibited and illegal. Always ensure proper authorization and consent before conducting any security assessments or penetration tests to promote responsible and ethical hacking practices._
